This program is based on John Peter's pamflet from 1677 called “Artificial Versifying, or the School-boy’s Recreation: A New Way to Make Latin Verses”.

The pamphlet states:

“I do assure you that by the subsequent Directions, you may with ease and facility enough, attain the Kernel, be speedily capacitated though (you understand not one word of Latin) to make almost Six hundred thousand different Latine Verses, as is hereafter declared.”

The pamphlet includes six tables containing letters, and instructions on how to follow them. The tables are attached, and the program follows Peter's instructions. The user only has to come up with a six-digit number sequence to generate a new verse, or press “r” to generate a random verse.
