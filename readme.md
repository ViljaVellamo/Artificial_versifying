How to update remote:

* make changes
* navigate to folder with cmd
* check status with "git status"
* add changes to a commit with "git add ."
* make the commit with "git commit -m [explain message in quotes]"
* push the commit to github with "git push"

Generally spam git status to check status and git diff to observe the changes
